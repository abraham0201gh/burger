### About the App

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a 'Devour it!' button. When the user clicks it, the burger moves to the right side of the page.

* The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
