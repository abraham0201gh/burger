### For Booleans use True/False.  In MySQL, zero is considered as false, and non-zero value is considered as true.  Table will populate with 0 and 1.


INSERT INTO burgers (burger_name, devoured) VALUES ("Express Burger", false);
INSERT INTO burgers (burger_name, devoured) VALUES ("Node Burger", false);
INSERT INTO burgers (burger_name, devoured) VALUES ("For Sure Burger", false);
